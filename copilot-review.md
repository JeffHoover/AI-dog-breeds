Here’s a code review of your repo **AI-dog-breeds**, focusing on non-canonical uses, risks, and missing features based on the available files and test coverage:

---

### Non-Canonical Uses

- **Simulated Auth Service**  
  Your `src/services/simulated-auth.ts` uses localStorage and dummy tokens to simulate authentication. This is a valid pattern for prototyping or early-stage apps, but it is non-canonical for production or even robust demos, where a mock API or real backend should be used.

- **Test Coverage for Static Content**  
  Your tests for layout components (Header, Footer) and routes mostly check for the presence of text or buttons. While this is a good start, this pattern can become brittle if UI copy changes and doesn’t fully validate behavior or accessibility.

- **Direct Delay in Auth Service**  
  The use of a manual `delay` function to simulate network latency is okay for local dev, but not a best practice for scalable mocking. Consider using dedicated mocking libraries or service workers for more control.

---

### Risks

- **No Real Authentication**  
  Storing a dummy token in localStorage poses no real security but could mislead developers or users into thinking their sessions are protected. If left in code, this is a risk for misunderstanding or accidental exposure.

- **Lack of Data Validation & Error Handling**  
  The signup and login functions return hardcoded values and do not validate input or handle errors. This could cause silent failures and is a risk if these functions are ever swapped for real API calls without improvement.

- **No Backend Integration**  
  The system appears to have no backend or API integration. There are no network calls or error handling for failed requests. If you move to real APIs, this will be a significant technical debt to pay down.

- **Minimal Security Practices**  
  There is no CSRF/XSS protection, and the simulated token could be read or written to by any script running on the client. This is not safe for real user data.

---

### Missing Features

- **User Feedback on Auth Errors**  
  There’s no indication in the tests or code that failed logins, signups, or expired sessions are handled or reported to the user.

- **Persistent User Sessions**  
  While localStorage is used for a token, there’s no logic for token expiry or refresh, making it unsuitable for even basic persistent sessions.

- **API Integration Layer**  
  No abstraction for real network calls is present. When moving to a backend, you’ll need interfaces for API requests, error management, and possibly state management.

- **Accessibility Checks**  
  Tests focus on presence of text, but do not check for ARIA roles, focus management, or keyboard navigation, which are critical for accessibility.

- **Feature Documentation**  
  The README is mostly the default Create React App instructions. There’s no documentation of app-specific features, routes, or state management.

- **No End-to-End or Integration Tests**  
  All tests are component-level. There are no integration or E2E tests to ensure flows (like login-then-navigate) work as expected.

---

### Suggestions

- Replace the simulated auth with a mock API or backend, and add proper input validation and error handling before using this app in a wider context.
- Add integration/E2E tests for full user flows.
- Update the README with actual project description, features, and usage instructions.
- Add accessibility checks in your test suite using tools like `axe` or `jest-axe`.
- Prepare an API abstraction layer to make the eventual migration to a backend easier.
- Document any non-canonical code patterns in the repo to help future contributors understand why they exist.
