Your AI-dog-breeds repo currently simulates user sessions using localStorage and dummy tokens in the client (see src/services/simulated-auth.ts and simulated-api.ts). This is suitable for prototyping, but not for real persistent sessions.

### How it works now
- On login, a "dummy" token is stored in localStorage.
- isAuthenticated() returns true if a token exists.
- logout() removes the token.
- There is no token expiry, refresh, or backend verification.
- No real backend API is used—everything is simulated in the frontend.

### How to implement real persistent user sessions

1. **Add a Backend Auth API**
   - Use Node.js/Express (or any backend) to handle authentication and manage sessions or JWT tokens.
   - On login/signup, the backend should issue a session cookie (httpOnly, secure) or a JWT.

2. **Frontend changes**
   - Replace the simulated-auth.ts logic with real API calls (e.g., via fetch or axios).
   - On successful login, the cookie/token from the backend will maintain the session.
   - Remove localStorage token logic, and rely on backend-issued tokens/cookies.

3. **Session Verification**
   - For each authenticated request, include the session cookie or token.
   - The backend checks validity and returns user data or errors as appropriate.

4. **Session Expiry & Logout**
   - The backend should set an expiry for the session/cookie.
   - On logout, the backend should clear the session, and the frontend should update UI accordingly.

#### Example: Express backend session code

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import session from 'express-session';

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: { maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, httpOnly: true }
}));

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // Validate credentials (from req.body)
  req.session.userId = user.id;
  res.send({ success: true });
});

app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.session.userId) return res.status(401).send('Not authenticated');
  // Return user data
});

app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.session.destroy(() => res.send({ success: true }));
});
```

#### What you’d change in your repo:
- Replace simulated-auth.ts API calls with real HTTP requests to your backend.
- Remove direct token storage in localStorage.
- Adjust your Auth components (Login, Signup) to handle API errors, session state, and redirect flows according to backend responses.

---

**Summary:** Your repo currently simulates sessions solely in the frontend (localStorage, dummy tokens). For real persistent sessions, you need a backend (Express or similar) to handle authentication, issue a real session/cookie/JWT, and validate it on each request. Update your frontend to communicate with this backend, and remove simulated session logic from the client.
